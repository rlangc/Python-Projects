Welcome to my collection of Python projects! This repository showcases hands-on practice with Python—from beginner-friendly CLI apps to more complex intermediate-level projects involving APIs, data parsing, and object-oriented design.

Each project is organized by skill level and includes:
- Clean, commented code
- Setup and usage instructions
- Feature overviews and potential future enhancements
